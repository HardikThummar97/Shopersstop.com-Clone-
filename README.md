# Shoppers-Stop Clone (e-commerce)

Shoppers-Stop Clone is a project where you can create a product, add the products to the cart, do a payment.
The design is based on Shoppers-Stop.com. We tried to implement different features from original website like product filters, slideshows, updating carts, sign in and sign up, dropdown list etc.
